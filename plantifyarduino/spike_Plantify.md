## Spike: measuring moisture

### 1) What problem are we trying to solve?
We want to measure how moist the dirt around the plant is without damaging the sensor with water.
We think 

### 2) Possible solution:
put the moisture sensor in the side of the plant cup and put electrical tape around the point of connection

### 2.1) Is this solution feasable?
- yes
 It will work because the water will never make its way to the points where the wire connects to the sensor. 
 We can put eletrical tape around the point of connection.

### 2.2) How much effort does this solution need?
- 10 minutes
- a knife
- electrical tape

### 2.3) Complete documentation of this solution
- take the plastic pot
- cut 2 small holes in the pot where the sensor will go in
- put the sensor in, use tape to keep it in place
- put electrical tape around the connection in case the customer accidentally spills water on it as a final safety measure


### 3) Alternative solution...
Put the moisture sensor into the pot through the top but just put electrical tape on it
### 3.1) Is this solution feasable?
It depends on if the electrical tape is tight enough, besides that it might not even have any effect if a small pool of water forms around the sensor
### 3.2) How much effort does this solution need?
- 5 minutes
- electrical tape
### 3.3) Complete documentation of this solution
- put the sensor in the dirt
- tape the connection tightly with electrical tape



## Spike: Arduino programming

### 1) What problem are we trying to solve?

We need to figure out how to program the arduino and retrieve data from it.

### 2) Possible solution:

Last semesters study materials combined with some research should be enough to
	help us get the desired results.

### 2.1) Is this solution feasible?

Yes.

### 2.2) How much effort does this solution need?

This task should be done in one to two days.


### 2.3) Complete documentation of this solution

In order to get the arduino working properly, we need the arduino, a laptop and an IDE like visual studio code.
After having read the needed information, we should be able to make some simple code and apply it to the arduino.
After having successfully compiled code to the arduino, we should test it by opening the terminal and making sure it’s producing the desired output.


### 3) Alternative solution…

In case the previous method does not work, we could reuse one of our older
projects that we know works with the arduino and make changes according to what
we need.

### 3.1) Is this solution feasible?

	Yes.

### 3.2) How much effort does this solution need?

	One afternoon or a day.

### 3.3) Complete documentation of this solution

	Having the solution at our disposal, all we need to do is erase the code that is
unrelated to our project, connect the arduino and make sure it is receiving and 
executing the commands given.



## Spike: Sensors

### 1) What problem are we trying to solve?

We need to figure out how to retrieve the readings provided by the sensors and convert them into usable values.

### 2) Possible solution:

Once the sensors are connected and programmed. We can do some tests to see if 
readings they give us are reliable and change in parallel to the elements they are 
measuring. 

### 2.1) Is this solution feasible?

Yes.

### 2.2) How much effort does this solution need?

This task should be done in one to two days.


### 2.3) Complete documentation of this solution

To get the desired results we’ll need the arduino, a laptop with an IDE, the sensors and the datasheets of the arduino and sensors.
After connecting the sensors properly and having read the datasheets, we should be able to turn on the sensors and get readings.
Once we get the values we’ll need to make sure they are usable, in other words if the
Given values from the sensors are not clear or readable we’ll have to convert them into something we can use.


### 3) Alternative solution…

In case the previous method does not work, we could consult one of our teachers
and get the help needed to get all the sensors up and running.

### 3.1) Is this solution feasible?

	Yes.

### 3.2) How much effort does this solution need?

	A day.

### 3.3) Complete documentation of this solution

	After not being able to make the sensors work on our own, we would approach a 
	teacher during integration class and ask him to help us out with the installation and 
	manipulation of the sensors.
